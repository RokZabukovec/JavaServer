# Java Server-Client communication
Implementation of UDP and TCP protocols in programming language Java.
This program was written for my compute science studies(computer networks) and was graded 15/15 points.
---
## Program process
First the server must be launched the the client connects to server using UDP protocol.
Client gets html document from our school website and counts every line in the document and saves it in a .txt file.
Then it sends the number of lines to the server program and prints "I connected to url and read the html document and saved the content to a file. Number of lines: XX ".
